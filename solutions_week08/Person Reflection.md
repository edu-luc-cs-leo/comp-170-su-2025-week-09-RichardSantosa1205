Comparing my Person class code to the provided solution helped me understand both what I did well and where I need to improve. One strength in my code is that it includes full testing at the bottom, allowing me to check that object comparisons and birthday formatting work as expected, and it gave me confidence that my code behaves correctly.

I also followed the correct structure for class methods, such as using accessors like get_first_name() and get_last_name(). My constructor and mutator methods were clear and aligned with good object-oriented practices. Another positive is that my code avoids a bug that exists in the solution, where it tries to access self.day, which was never defined. I used the birthday object properly to get the day and month values.

However, there are a few things I could improve. In my say_birthday() method, I tried to create ordinal day endings using the last digit of the number (like 1st, 2nd, 3rd), but I forgot to account for exceptions like 11th, 12th, and 13th. These are special cases that don’t follow the usual pattern. The solution handles this more accurately by checking specific values.

Also, I used _birthday as the name of my birthday attribute, which is slightly inconsistent with how I named other attributes like first_name and last_name. For clarity and consistency, I should have stuck with birthday.

Overall, I’m happy with how my code works, but improving consistency and logic for special cases would make it stronger.
