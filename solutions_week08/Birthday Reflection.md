Comparing my code to the provided solution helped me understand both the strengths in my approach and where I can continue to grow. One thing I’m proud of is how I used the day_in_year() method inside the days_until() function. This made my code cleaner and avoided repeating the same logic. The other version did the day calculations separately, which made the function longer. Using one method to handle both parts was not only more efficient but also easier to read.

Another strong point was how I handled the set_month() method. I correctly used self.__month, keeping it consistent with the way other attributes were written in the class. I feel this shows a good understanding of how private variables should be used in Python.

Even though my code works well, I noticed I could improve how I explain my thinking through comments. The other version included more comments, which made it easier to understand the purpose of each part. In future projects, I’ll make sure to add more helpful notes.

I also realized that while my code handles dates accurately, it doesn’t consider leap years. Even though that wasn’t required, including it or at least mentioning it would have shown extra attention to detail.

Overall, I think my code was solid, but adding better documentation and handling more cases would make it even stronger.
